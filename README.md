ESX Doorlock with autolock function

This is just the same esx_doorlock that been shared before but I added a autolock function.

What is autolock function?
-It auto locks the door when you are far away from it so no need to press again or so whatever. I added this function cause I hate waiting for the door to finish swinging hahahaha

And I change something, instead of getting thte objectName I change it to HashKey less hassle :)
